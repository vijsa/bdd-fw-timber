ui automation project for Zeidler 


Scenario:
During the current sprint, we have added a new feature in our CMS Admin section to enable Admin users to upload images (We already had ability to upload files and videos).
As a QA Engineer you have to write all important test cases which will help you and the product owners to test this new feature. You are also required to automate any two of the above test cases using any open source tool of your choice, which will help in regression testing.
Here are the details of the demo environment which you can use for your testing and to develop automated tests.

User story:
As a logged in Admin user, I should be able to upload images through the FILES sections on CMS Admin, so that I can use these images while creating content on the site.
